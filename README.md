# Corona Spin

This game is an adaptation of the tradicional slot-machine games with a corona virus tematic. In Corona Spin, each slot is considered to be an action. The order of these actions is very importat to the final score of the game.

The website has three sections: How to play, New game and Leaderboard. 
In the how to play section you can find an explanation for the main idea of the game, as well as information about your initial score and how to multiply your bet. This section also shows the function of each action that can appear in the game.

In the New game tab is where we can find the slot machine. In here, there are three slots that will change after each spin. Each spin has a cost of 2 points, but this can be multiplied by the bet multiplier buttons. The slot machine shows 2 scores: the one at the left shows the result of the last spin, and the one on the right the player's score. At the bottom, you can also find 2 more buttons: restart and put this score on the leaderboard. The restart button will refresh the page, and you start your game from the beginning. If you chose to put your score on the leaderboard, the game will end and you will be redirected to the leaderboard page, which will have your name and score added.

The leaderboard section is a local scoreboard that uses the local storage to rank the results of the games played on that browser. If no game was played, it only shows some fantasy initial score information.
